			<h3>(The Eve of my 21st Birthday)</h3>
			<p>Time is such a strange thing. When I got out of the shower today, I found myself vaguely surprised to have made it this far. That makes it sound like I expected to die, but I didn’t. I guess I never really thought about this as something that would really happen. Like turning twenty-one was something for other people, but not really me. But here we are. </p>
			<p>Looking back, there’s a lot I wouldn’t change, and a few things I would. I wouldn’t change breaking my nose and starting to mountain bike. I wouldn’t change choosing to go to CU. I wouldn’t change playing soccer, and I definitely wouldn’t reconsider quitting. </p>
			<p>On the other hand, my stint with anorexia, the repercussions of which are still shaking me, I would do anything in my power to prevent. Not necessarily for me—I learned a lot about through that experience, horrible as it was—but for my family. That wasn’t something I should have ever put them through, and no force on earth will make me put them through it again. I also could have been more social in high school. I could have made some real friends and fought off the bitter loneliness I experienced for so many years. But I didn’t. </p>
			<p>Looking forward, I wonder what forty-two will feel like. I’ve had a wild ride thus far. I hope that I never get bored. I hope I love what I’m doing, whatever it is, and if I don’t, I hope I’m brave enough to move. Change scares me. It scares me a lot. I hope I’m strong enough and wise enough to know myself and face down that fear. I hope, when I look back from forty-two, I can be happy with the progress I’ve made in my second set of twenty-one years. </p>
			<p>Looking at the present, I don’t have much to say. I love where I am, but I don’t deserve it. I’ve had a free and easy ride, comparatively. My only hardships have been self inflicted. Tomorrow will be a day for self-inflicted hardships, but the good kind. The memory-making, type-two fun kind. Here's the plan:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Wake up early</li>
				<li>Take the bus to the trailhead</li>
				<li>Be outside for a hella long time</li>
				<li>Go home, bathe</li>
				<li>Go out to dinner with friends</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here's the added spice:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It’s been raining for two days (so yes, Perry, it is muddy)</li>
				<li>It’s going to snow between three and five inches tonight </li>
				<li>We are going to hike (up) and run (flats and down) twenty-one miles</li>
				<li>It is the skyline traverse, so we will summit five peaks (Sanitas, Flagstaff, Green, Bear, South) </li>
				<li>It is supposed to snow all day</li>
				<li>One of the people I’m forcing to join me (Perry) got squished by a rock and has seven stitches in his hand.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It’s going to be a blast. 
				But honestly, things like this are the reason that I am proud to be who I am. I am coming to like the girl that runs the skyline traverse in the snow instead of getting hammered at the bars. I’m still working on realizing that she (me) is not an extrovert and never will be, but that is okay. It has been a good journey so far, but I won’t say I can’t wait to see what comes. Actually, if time could slow down a bit and let me catch up, that would be fine by me.

			<h3>...Dreams</h3>
			<p>Once upon a time, there was a girl who dreamed she could write. She dreamed that she could weave worlds like J.K. Rowling and J.R.R Tolkien. She dreamed that her words would take wing and pull others off the ground as she herself had been pulled so many times before, that she would get to cast the line that drew the drowning sailor into shore, as she’d been drawn many times before. She dreamed that she could write the lonely child’s best friend, as her friends crawled out of the pages to keep her company.</p> 
			<p>Then, she grew up. Everyday she shook hands with lonely because best friends in books didn’t do much to combat the growing ache inside her chest, the lack of breath, as she realized she hadn’t spoken to a living being in days. And no one noticed. She realized the silence resounded in her ears and filled her head with ringing and black and white characters on a page couldn’t fill that space. She realized books were a stand in for a reality she was too afraid to chase. </p>
			<p>So what did she do when she realized her dream was hollow? It didn’t ring true any longer when she said “I want to be an author.” When she realized helping people run from reality wouldn’t fix the problems we all need to face, as humans, as a race? What does anyone do when a dream needs to die? Do you keep it alive? Feed it, cradle it, protect it from the cold? </p>
			<p>I’ve heard dreams are given—a gift from god above. But that’s a load of hogwash. Dreams are not given. Dreams are chosen and held. We aren’t born for something greater than ourselves. We are born, and then we pick. We actively choose. We choose who we are and we choose what we do. I can spend my whole life waiting for a dream to fall into my lap, and I will die waiting for that. If I choose to be small, to live for me, that’s what I’ll do and that’s what I’ll be. If I choose to stretch, to reach, and, likely, to fall, it’s impossible to say if I’ll get anywhere at all. But I’ll know that I tried. My dreams lived and, under their own power, died. </p>
			<p>So what did she do, our world-building girl? She set the dream aside for a while and ventured out into the great unknown to hunt up another passion, a new gift. She made friends with real people who got angry and hurt. She struggled to smile, she struggled to laugh, she struggled to find magic and to find a new path. She’s struggling still, day in and day out. Somethings have gotten easier, some days are still bad, but her chest is less hollow, the lonely ache less acute. The dream sits in the corner, ignored and unused. One day she’ll find a way to make reality and writing meet. Until then, she’ll search, she’ll scour the earth, for that spot of inspiration that will give a new dream birth. </p>
